# BCImodel
Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model for audiovisual spatial perception

Fit the Bayesian Causal Inference model (KÃ¶rding, Beierholm, Ma, Quartz, Tenenbaum, Shams, 2007, PLOS One) to experimental data of one subject.  

This fitting function has been developed in order to be flexible with respect to the number of parameters that one wants to fit and to share parameters across experimental conditions. 

Please ensure that you download the following toolboxes and copy them into their respective folders: 'bads', 'gofit', 'vbmc', 'psisloo_DM', 'eissample_lite_DM2'.
References and github links can be found in the readme.txt files in the toolbox folders.

For detailed explanations of the BCImodel options and settings please see "BCImodel.m"
For example usage, please see "BCIparameterRecoveryScript.m".
