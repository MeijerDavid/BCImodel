EISSAMPLE is a self-tuning MCMC algorithm developed by Luigi Acerbi. 
Starting from his 'lite' version I removed code that was never called and then made changes to improve readability.
I also added some functionality in an attempt to improve convergence speed, but the core algorithm did not change.
